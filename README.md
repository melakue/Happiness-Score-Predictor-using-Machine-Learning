# Happiness-Score-Predictor-using-Machine-Learning

Machine learning technique is used to train the machine and create a happiness score predictor model which predict happiness score of a country based on input provided by a user. The happiness score factors that are considered for this project are GDP per capita, Generocity, Life expectancy and Fertility. Three years data for each of the factors were collecetd from various data sources, got cleaned using Jupyter Notebbok and used to create the model. Once the scores are determined, JS and HTML are used to create user interface to take input caculate the result and display the happiness score back to the user.

  * Scikit-learn Machine learning library is used
  * Due to the linear nature of relationship between the factors and happiness score, Linear regression model is used.
